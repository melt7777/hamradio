HAM Radio resources and notes

## general ham / preparedness info

You can listen to any frequency that you like. You only have to worry about legality when you push the Transmit (PTT) button. 

There are channels called FRS where you can transmit on low power (<2W) - many walkie talkies use this. Can't get much range maybe a few miles line of sight.

There are also MURS channels where you might need a license to transmit. 

If you get your own FCC HAM License you get a callsign and you can use the HAM bands and talk to other people farther away using repeaters. You can also use more power to transmit further. But you have to use the rules of the radio and never interfere with anyone's other communications. License is online now and about $20. Electronics theory and other stuff. A few hours worth of video watching could be enough for most semi technical folks.

## hardware

I started my journey with these mobile compact radios from Baofeng. They work in multiple frequency ranges (bands), so that prevents them from getting a "approval" for transmitting on the public requencies. But they are inexpensive, and popular, so there's plenty of support/accessories.

## programming

You can manually program with the radio but using software is much better. I was able to use both the OEM (VIP) software and the CHIRP software to program the channels and the settings. It's like programming the presets on your radio in your vehicle.
